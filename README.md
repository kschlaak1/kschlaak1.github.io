Some projects I've worked on:



- [Life](life/life.html) - This is Conway's Game of Life contstructed with HTML, PHP, CSS, and Javascript. 

  - [Here](life/login.php)  - This is a login page used to access Conway's Game of Life page thru php. (Database currently not running)

  - I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6erkLc7cwDs&t=16s) where I explain what Conway's Game of Life is and a demo of it all working together while explaining how it was made.

- [Wheel of Fortune]() - This is a web version of the popular game show 'Wheel of Fortune' using only HTML, CSS, and PHP.

- [eCommerce database project]() - Here, my team constructed a database that was modeled for an e-commerce retailer using SQL.

  - I made a [video]() where I demonstrate the SQL script functioning as I explain the architecture of the database and its tables.
