Some projects I've worked on:



[Life](life/life.html) - This is Conway's Game of Life contstructed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. (Made accessable with no database)

-[Here](life/login.php)  - This is a login page used to access Conway's Game of Life page thru php. (Database must be running)

-I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6erkLc7cwDs&t=16s) showing a demo of it all working together and explaining how it was made.

- [Quick start]
