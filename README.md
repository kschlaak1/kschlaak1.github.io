Some projects I've worked on:



- [Life](life/life.html) - This is Conway's Game of Life contstructed with HTML, PHP, CSS, and Javascript. 

  - I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6erkLc7cwDs&t=16s) where I explain what Conway's Game of Life is and a demo of it all working together while explaining how it was made. This video also showcases the registering, and verification process of a user account into a database using php and SQL. 

- [Wheel of Fortune](wheel_of_fortune) - This is a web version of the popular game show 'Wheel of Fortune' using only HTML, CSS, and PHP. The HTML makes the game visitable, while the PHP provides all of the games logic, and the CSS illustrates the games animations. No demonstration available as I currently have no server to run it.

- [eCommerce database project]() - Here, my team constructed a database that was modeled for an e-commerce retailer using SQL.

  - I made a [video]() where I demonstrate the SQL script functioning as I explain the architecture of the database and its tables.
